        "- **Key price driver:** In the initial model, `Base Fare` accounted for 99.6% of fare variation — confirming that the dataset's total fare is simply the sum of base fare and taxes. This data leakage has been fixed for future model runs.\n",
        "- **Airline pricing:** Turkish Airlines charges the highest average fare (75,547 BDT), while Vistara and Singapore Airlines are at the budget end (~68,100–68,300 BDT). The spread between the most and least expensive airlines is about 7,400 BDT.\n",
        "- **Seasonal patterns:** Winter fares are ~16% higher than other seasons (78,772 vs ~68,000 BDT), likely driven by holiday travel demand during December–February.\n",
        "- **Route impact:** International long-haul routes (SPD→BKK, CXB→YYZ, CXB→LHR) consistently command fares above 115,000 BDT, while domestic routes are dramatically cheaper.\n",
